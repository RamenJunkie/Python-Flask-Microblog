## Usage Guide

### First Time Setup

1. **Create Admin Account** - On first run, you'll be prompted to create an admin account
   - **Note**: Only ONE admin account can be created during initial setup
   - After setup is complete, the setup page is no longer accessible
2. **Configure Credentials** - Go to Settings and enter your Bluesky and Mastodon API credentials
3. **Start Posting** - You're ready to go!

### Public Access

- **Anyone can view** the timeline without logging in
- Visitors see all posts with images and links
- Search functionality available to all
- Only logged-in admin can create posts, manage queue, or change settings

### Managing Credentials

All API credentials are stored securely in the local SQLite database:
- Navigate to **Settings** in the top menu
- Update your Bluesky or Mastodon credentials anytime
- Passwords are stored securely using industry-standard hashing

### Creating Posts

**Text Post:**
- Just enter your text in the main field
- Check "Post immediately" to post right away
- Uncheck to add to the hourly queue
- Check "Local only" to add to timeline without posting to social networks

**Link Post:**
- Enter text in the main field
- Add a URL in the "Link" field
- The app automatically fetches title, description, and featured image
- Creates rich link previews on both platforms (unless local only)

**Image Post:**
- Enter caption text
- Upload an image file (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- Image is stored locally and posted to both platforms (unless local only)
- **Images are displayed inline** in the timeline for all visitors

**Local-Only Posts:**
- Check the "Local only" checkbox
- Post appears in your timeline immediately
- Does NOT get posted to Bluesky or Mastodon
- Perfect for personal notes or drafts you want to keep locally

### Queue Management

- View queued posts at `/queue`
- Posts are automatically posted every hour (if nothing else has been posted)
- Delete items from queue as needed
- Manual posts reset the 1-hour timer

### Archive & Search

- All posts are archived with timestamps
- Full-text search across content
- Paginated view (20 posts per page)
- Click links to open original URLs

### RSS Feed Integration

**Add RSS Feeds:**
- Navigate to the RSS page
- Enter an RSS feed URL (e.g., `https://example.com/feed.xml`)
- Optionally give it a friendly name
- Click "Add Feed"

**Browse and Share Articles:**
- Click "Browse" on any saved feed
- View the 15 most recent entries
- See title, summary, author, and publication date
- Add optional commentary
- Click "Add to Queue" to schedule for posting
- Articles will be posted with your commentary and a link

**Manage Feeds:**
- View all saved RSS feeds
- Delete feeds you no longer need
- Feeds persist between sessions in the database

## Configuration Options

### Change Auto-Post Interval

Edit the `auto_poster_thread()` function in `app.py`:

```python
if time.time() - last_auto_post_time >= 3600:  # 3600 = 1 hour
```

Change `3600` to your desired interval in seconds (e.g., `7200` for 2 hours).

### Change Posts Per Page

Edit the `index()` route in `app.py`:

```python
result = get_posted_entries(page=page, per_page=20)  # Change 20
```

### Customize Styling

Edit `static/css/style.css` to modify:
- Colors (change `#5b7ec4` for primary accent)
- Layout width (change `.container max-width`)
- Dark mode shades
- Typography

## Production Deployment

### Using Gunicorn

```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

### Systemd Service (Linux)

Create `/etc/systemd/system/microblog.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Flask Microblog
After=network.target

[Service]
User=yourusername
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/flask-microblog
Environment="PATH=/path/to/flask-microblog/venv/bin"
ExecStart=/path/to/flask-microblog/venv/bin/gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable microblog
sudo systemctl start microblog
sudo systemctl status microblog
```

### Nginx Reverse Proxy

Add to your Nginx configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location /static {
        alias /path/to/flask-microblog/static;
        expires 30d;
    }

    location /images {
        alias /path/to/flask-microblog/images;
        expires 30d;
    }
}
```

### HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Use Environment Variables

Instead of hardcoding credentials in `app.py`, use environment variables:

```python
import os

BLUESKY_HANDLE = os.getenv('BLUESKY_HANDLE')
BLUESKY_PASSWORD = os.getenv('BLUESKY_PASSWORD')
MASTODON_INSTANCE_URL = os.getenv('MASTODON_INSTANCE_URL')
MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN = os.getenv('MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN')
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', 'fallback-dev-key')
```

Set them in your environment:

```bash
export BLUESKY_HANDLE='your-handle.bsky.social'
export BLUESKY_PASSWORD='your-app-password'
export MASTODON_INSTANCE_URL='https://your-instance.social'
export MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN='your-access-token'
export SECRET_KEY='your-random-secret-key'
```

### 2. File Permissions

### 3. File Permissions

```bash
chmod 600 topost.txt posted.txt microblog.db
chmod 700 images/
```

### 4. Firewall Configuration

```bash
sudo ufw allow 5000/tcp  # If exposing directly
# Or only allow nginx
### 4. Firewall Configuration

```bash
sudo ufw allow 5000/tcp  # If exposing directly
# Or only allow nginx
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
```

### 5. Regular Updates

```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Access Application

**Issue**: Redirected to setup page when user already exists
- **Solution**: Navigate directly to `/login` or delete `microblog.db` to start fresh

### Forgot Admin Password

**Issue**: Cannot log in to the application
- **Solution**: Delete `microblog.db` to reset (Note: This will also delete your API credentials)
- **Better Solution**: Add a password reset feature or create a new admin via Python:

```python
import sqlite3
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash

conn = sqlite3.connect('microblog.db')
c = conn.cursor()
c.execute('UPDATE users SET password_hash = ? WHERE username = ?', 
          (generate_password_hash('new-password'), 'admin'))
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

### RSS Feeds Not Loading

**Issue**: Cannot fetch RSS feed entries
- **Solution**: Verify the RSS feed URL is correct and accessible
- Check if the feed is valid RSS/Atom format
- Test the feed URL in an RSS reader first
- Check console for feedparser errors

### Cannot Add RSS Feed

**Issue**: "Invalid RSS feed" error
- **Solution**: Ensure the URL points to an actual RSS/Atom feed (usually ends in .xml, .rss, or /feed)
- Some sites have RSS feeds at `/feed`, `/rss`, or `/atom`
- Check if the site blocks automated requests

### RSS Entries Show Wrong Date

**Issue**: Published dates appear incorrect
- **Solution**: This is the date from the feed itself - contact the feed publisher if incorrect

### Posts Not Appearing on Social Media

- Verify credentials are correct in Settings page
- Check console output for error messages
- Test network connectivity to both platforms
- Ensure API permissions are correct (Mastodon needs `write:statuses` and `write:media`)

### Images Not Uploading

- Check `images/` folder exists and is writable
- Verify file size is under 16MB
- Ensure file format is supported (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- Check console for PIL/Pillow errors

### Auto-Posting Not Working

- Ensure Flask app is running continuously (not just for testing)
- Check `topost.txt` has content
- Verify background thread started (check console on startup)
- Ensure at least 1 hour has passed since last post

### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Find process using port 5000
lsof -i :5000

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>

# Or use a different port
python app.py --port 5001
```
